## What is this Repo?

The very first Line of Code was in C, many years ago.
But because I had no clue about programming and no Internet back then, 
my attempt to learn C failed miserably. 
<br>

The Idea of this Repo to document my second try to learn C.
<br>
Everyday I practice, I will create a branch and push some little Piece of Code 
on it just so i can keep an Eye on my progress. 

### But why is it public ?

So that you dear reader can look over my Code and give me any pointers
<br>
*(fully intended, but still: sorry)*
that you might have.

## Learning Diary 

At the moment i dont have the Time to practice every Day, so there might be a bit of time between "Days".

### Day 1  
I wrote FizzBizz in C - so nothing big, but it is a start. 
<br>
An unexpected difficulty was printing an Integer.  
Because:    
        
    printf(number)

would not work, so I tried:

    print("%c", number)

witch transformed my Number into a char, but not in the way I expected 
<br>
The Solution looks like this: 
    
    printf("%d", number)
